# 6 Web App Ideas for Starting Your Business

Creating a unique and creative web application that can be useful for users is not the simplest task to do. Therefore, we’ve researched the market to find the best web app ideas in 2021 that’ll give you a great start for your online business.

## What is a Web Application?

It can be accessed through any browser with an Internet connection and can be used for various different purposes. A web application is a computer-based program that uses online technologies to operate a different range of tasks.

We hope that our list of 6 [web application ideas](https://www.designveloper.com/en/blog/7-awesome-web-app-ideas-for-web-developer/) will assist you in this process of finding an idea for your own project.

## 1. Quick advising services

Imagine having a platform where people can turn in for advice and get answers only from the professionals of the field. It can be like a paid version of Quora where all the advice is right and working.

The challenging part of this web application idea is that you have to create your base by choosing all your specialists one by one.

## 2. Tinder but for books

Similar to the previous web app idea, this one will also be extremely popular with book lovers. It’s a fun and easy-to-use web app for users to find new books to their taste.

All they need to do is to fill in some information about their favorite books, authors, or genre, and the app will come up with multiple new suggestions. You can also add some more features to stand out in the market. From then on, they can swipe left and right on books, and it will match them with other books similar to their favorite ones.

## 3. Book review web application

There are too many good books in the world. Almost as many as there are bad ones. Many of us turn to Goodreads for the solution, but often the service is more focused on selling the books and less on giving honest opinions about them. That’s why every book lover tries to find out if the book is worth the time they are willing to spend.

To help them out, you can turn this web app idea into reality. That’s why creating a platform with a better review system both from ordinary readers and critics can become a successful startup idea.

## 4. Healthy food alternatives for your favorite snacks

We all have our guilty pleasures – our favorite snacks, right? The users just have to type the snack that they are craving for and the web app will come up with healthy options. Of course, people still can consult a specialist or try to find healthy alternatives for their diet.

And though we know how unhealthy and harmful they can sometimes be, excluding them from our diet is a tough task. That’s why we all could use some help from professionals. There can be recipes that everyone can make at home or products with better ingredients they can find online.

## 5. Recipe suggestion web app based on the availability of your ingredients

It works like many cooking apps – by suggesting you an easy and fast recipe that you can cook at home. But here’s the twist: before suggesting a recipe, it asks the users what products they have at hand and only afterwards offers them the best recipe options.

Many of us became our own cooks with the pandemic hitting all our favorite restaurants and cafés. However, coming up with fresh food ideas for every day can be tiring sometimes. That’s why our next web project idea can become a real game-changer for many people.

## 6. Web app for family interactions

It’s a really good web app idea and can become highly successful if you take your time and think through the feature set and available tools. Family is an essential part of our lives but organizing things with each other can be a real headache sometimes. That’s why creating a tool to connect families can be a really cool web app idea.

Imagine a [web app development platform](https://www.designveloper.com/en/blog/7-best-application-development-software-platforms/) that contains a shared gallery, a family calendar, to-do lists for every individual member, an event planner, and even separate chat boxes for everyone.
